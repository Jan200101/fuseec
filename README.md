# fuseec - fusee-launcher-port

This branch of fuseec is direct port of [fusee-launcher](https://github.com/Qyriad/fusee-launcher/) by Qyriad

The minimum viable product only supports Linux with the intention to implement proper low level abstractions for multiple operating systems to be supported and easily integrated with.
